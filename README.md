Sup,

I'm Luke Rimmington and  I am a self-taught, hobbyist programmer from Australia and this is my ReadMe file for anyone interested. I have been programming since 
I was 13 so I am fluent in the following languages:

HTML, CSS, JS, Python and C# 

With a few more I am partially fluent in. 
This is my Github personal portfolio.
